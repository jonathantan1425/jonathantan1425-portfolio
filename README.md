# Jonathan Tan's Portfolio
#### Under my alias, `jonathantan1425`
Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website.
It is currently hosted at www.jonathantan1425.com.

I built this as an avenue to learn front-end web development, as well as showcase some of my works and personality. I'm always open to chatting and feedback, so feel free to reach out!

## Tech Stack Used
* Next.js
* TailwindCSS
* Vercel (deployment)

## Moving Forward
* Add success/failure response for Contact
* Add loading screen
* Clean up the codebase, abstraction of logic
* Try out better UI and animations

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
