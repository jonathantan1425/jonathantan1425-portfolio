# Jonathan Tan's Portfolio
#### Under my alias, `jonathantan1425`
Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website.
It is currently hosted at www.jonathantan1425.com.

I built this as an avenue to learn front-end web development, as well as showcase some of my works and personality. I'm always open to chatting and feedback, so feel free to reach out!

## Tech Stack Used
* Next.js
* TailwindCSS
* Vercel (deployment)

## Moving Forward
* Add success/failure response for Contact
* Add loading screen
* Clean up the codebase, abstraction of logic
* Try out better UI and animations
